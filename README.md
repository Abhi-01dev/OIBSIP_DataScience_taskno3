# OIBSIP_DataScience_taskno3
📌 Objective

To predict the selling price of used cars based on features like brand, year, fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven using Machine Learning algorithms.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains details of used cars such as:

Car Name/Company

Year of Purchase

Fuel Type

Transmission Type

Kilometers Driven

Present Price

Selling Price (target variable)

🛠 Tools Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🔄 Steps Performed
Loaded and explored the dataset

Cleaned data and handled missing values

Converted categorical data into numerical form (encoding)

Performed feature selection

Split data into training and testing sets

Applied Machine Learning models (Linear Regression / Random Forest)

Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, and R² score

✅ Outcome

Successfully predicted car prices with good accuracy

Identified important factors affecting price (year, fuel type, kms driven)

Gained hands-on experience in regression modeling and data preprocessing
